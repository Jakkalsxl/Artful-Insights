                <p id="text" class="left" style="padding-left:10%">There are many types and styles of painting that are and have been used by humans as far back as 40,000 Years! Painting has been used for many years to express ones emotions, thaughts and experiences through generations all the way back from our early human ancestors to our current selves our creativity has but only improved. As our civilization inproved so did out methods of expressing ourselves, which is why we will be covering 6 different types of painting.</p>

                <p id="text1" class="left" style="padding-left:10%">Watercolor is a painting method in which the paints are made of pigments suspended in a water-soluble vehicle. The traditional and most common support for watercolor paintings is paper; other canvases include papyrus, bark papers, plastics, vellum or leather, fabric, wood and canvas. There are various types of watercolors used by artists. Some examples are pan water, liquid watercolors, watercolor brush pens, and watercolor pencils. Watercolor pencils (water-soluble color pencils) can even be used either wet or dry.</p>

                <p id="text2" class="right" style="padding-right:10%">Oil painting is the process of painting with pigments that are bound with a medium of drying oil, like linseed oil, which was widely used in early modern Europe. The oil was often boiled with a resin like pine resin or even frankincense; these were called varnishes and were prized for their body and gloss. Oil paint eventually became the principal medium used for creating artworks as its advantages became widely known. The transition began with Early Netherlandish painting in northern Europe, and by the height of the Renaissance oil painting techniques had almost completely replaced tempera paints in the majority of Europe.</p>

                <p id="header3" class="left">Pastel</p>
                <p id="text3" class="left" style="padding-left:10%">Pastel is a painting medium in the form of a stick, consisting of pure powdered pigment and a binder. The pigments used in pastels are the same as those used to produce all colored art media, including oil paints. The color effect of pastels is closer to the natural dry pigments than that of any other process. Because the surface of a pastel painting is fragile and easily smudged, its preservation requires protective measures such as framing under glass; it may also be sprayed with a fixative. Nonetheless, when made with permanent pigments and properly cared for, a pastel painting may endure unchanged for centuries. Pastels are not susceptible, as are paintings made with a fluid medium, to the cracking and discoloration that result from changes in the color, opacity, or dimensions of the medium as it dries.</p>

                <p id="header4" class="right">Acrylic</p>
                <p id="text4" class="right" style="padding-right:10%">Acrylic paint is fast drying paint containing pigment suspension in an acrylic polymer emulsion. Acrylic paints can be diluted with water, but become water-resistant when dry. Depending on how much the paint is diluted with water or modified with acrylic gels, media, or pastes, the finished acrylic painting can resemble a watercolor or an oil painting, or have its own unique characteristics not attainable with other media. The main practical difference between most acrylics and oil paints is the inherent drying time. Oils allow for more time to blend colors and apply even glazes over under-paintings. This slow drying aspect of oil can be seen as an advantage for certain techniques, but may also impede the artist's ability to work quickly.</p>

                <p id="text5" class="left" style="padding-left:10%">Aerosol paint (also called spray paint) is a type of paint that comes in a sealed pressurized container and is released in a fine spray mist when depressing a valve button. A form of spray painting, aerosol paint leaves a smooth, evenly coated surface. Standard sized cans are portable, inexpensive and easy to store. Aerosol primer can be applied directly to bare metal and many plastics. Speed, portability and permanence also make aerosol paint a common graffiti medium. In the late 1970s, street graffiti writers' signatures and murals became more elaborate and a unique style developed as a factor of the aerosol medium and the speed required for illicit work. Many now recognize graffiti and street art as a unique art form and specifically manufactured aerosol paints are made for the graffiti artist. A stencil protects a surface, except the specific shape to be painted. Stencils can be purchased as movable letters, ordered as professionally cut logos or hand-cut by artists.</p>

                <p id="text6" class="right" style="padding-right:10%">Digital painting is a method of creating an art project digitally or a technique for making digital art on the computer. As a method of creating an art object, it adapts traditional painting medium such as acrylic paint, oils, ink, watercolor, etc. and applies the pigment to traditional carriers, such as woven canvas cloth, paper, polyester, etc. by means of software. As a technique, it refers to a computer graphics software program that uses a virtual canvas and virtual painting box of brushes, colors, and other supplies. The virtual box contains many instruments that do not exist outside the computer, and which give a digital artwork a different look and feel from an artwork that is made the traditional way. The artist uses his own painting technique to create a particular piece of work on the computer.</p>
