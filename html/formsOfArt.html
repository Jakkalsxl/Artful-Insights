                <p id="text" class="left" style="padding-left:10%">Through our history many forms of art have developed in our society so much so that the line of the arts and society have become somewhat blured. From the designs of the tallest skyscrapers to the smaller actions we make like how one would set their plant to make their desk more aesthetically pleasing. We will therefore not be going over what counts as art but rather the creative outlets we have devoleped</p>

                <p id="text1" class="right" style="padding-right:10%">You may not believe it but the consept of storytelling with the assistance of images has been around for alot longer than you might think, one of which is know as Shadow play or shadow puppetry. It is an ancient form of storytelling and entertainment which uses flat articulated cut-out figures (shadow puppets) which are held between a source of light and a translucent screen or scrim. And through  the centuries the method of visual storry telling has only improved from images moving to sound and color to more complicated methods suck as special effects and animation.</p>

                <p id="text2" class="left" style="padding-left:10%">Comics is a medium used to express ideas with images, often combined with text or other visual information, and it typically takes the form of a sequence of panels of images. Comics can be made by anyone if they are determined enough and is a great way of story telling. Comics today are generally used all over the world and come in many forms, from the small comic strips you'd find in newspapers to entire worlds of adventure, love, mystery, visual effects and action.</p>

                <p id="text3" class="right" style="padding-right:10%">The practice of applying paint, pigment, color or other medium to a solid surface. The expression of ideas and emotions, with the creation of certain aesthetic qualities, in a two-dimensional visual language. It is obvious that paintings hold a special place in the history of humans. Used to express a multitude of thoughts and feelings paintings and the methods used to make them has only inproved our creativity and desire build.</p>

                <p id="text4" class="left" style="padding-left:10%">For those who have a harder time expressing themselves, reading poetry can have a similar positive effect as writing it. Reading poetry allows one to see into the soul of another person, see what is weighing on their minds and on their hearts, and can open doors to feelings that are sometimes suppressed until that door is opened. By design, poetry is broken into short, but strategic sentences. By doing so, writing and reading poetry makes one understand the significance of every single word and their placement. Sometimes, without a single word, it can change the entire rhythm and meaning of the poem itself. Writing poetry forces the person to consider, and reconsider, each piece and length of their verses.</p>

                <p id="header5" class="right">Music</p>
                <p id="text5" class="right" style="padding-right:10%">Music is generally defined as the art of arranging sound to create some combination of form, harmony, melody, rhythm or otherwise expressive content. It is also often debated as to what extent the origins of music will ever be understood. There are however hinds that can arrise such as the Divje Babe flute, carved from a cave bear femur, thought 40,000 years old, or musical instruments in egipt dating back to the Predynastic period. As the human race matured the music only followed, from Classicism, such as Symphony No.40 G minor, to rock music.</p>

                <p id="text6" class="left" style="padding-left:10%">There are many genres of video game. The first commercial video game, Pong, was a simple simulation of table tennis. As processing power increased, new genres such as adventure and action games were developed that involved a player guiding a character from a third person perspective through a series of obstacles. This "real-time" element cannot be easily reproduced by a board game, which is generally limited to "turn-based" strategy, this advantage allows video games to simulate situations such as combat more realistically. Along with the increase of the processing power of computers the use of storytelling through the use of video games became more prevalent.</p>

                <div>
                    <p id="text7" class="right" style="padding-right:10%">If you can believe it the origins of writing appear during the start of the pottery-phase of the Neolithic, when clay tokens were used to record specific amounts of livestock or commodities. Writing, although prevelent in many aspects, is a great way of storytelling which anyone with a pen and paper can use regardless of skill.</p>
                    <p id="text8" class="right" style="padding-right:10%">Art can come in many forms and anyone can make something beautiful if the try. In the words Henri Matisse - “Creativity takes courage.”</p>
